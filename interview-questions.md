1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

Your answer: I do not know the difference between a parameter and an arguemnt. I just know that they both are () parantheses. 

Researched answer: A parameter holds a variable and recieves the argument. While an argument passes a value to a function. 

2. The JavaScript built in method .map() takes predefined parameters. What are they? Which are required and which are optional?

Your answer: The main parameter that .map() takes in would be arrays because .map() is an iteration that runs through an array, some optional ones are strings and numbers because they can be turned into arrays. 

Researched answer: The required value is a current value. It holds the current element like a string, or number. The optional parameters that it holds would be the index and array. The index holds the location of the current value while the array hold an array. 

3. What is the difference between map and filter?

Your answer: .map() is like the for loop. It is a faster way to write down a for loop. The .filter() is like an if statement, a conditional statement.  

Researched answer: .map() transforms each element into an array while the .filter() creates an array that satisfies a certain condition. 

4. What is iteration?

Your answer: Iteration is the process of going over code. In other words, repetition. Iteration is like the for loop. It goes over a code over and over until a condition is met. 

Researched answer: Iteration is the repetition of steps or looping. 

5. What is the difference between a function and a method?

Your answer: Having only worked on methods for a short period of time, I am unsure what the difference is. 

Researched answer: A function is independent and does not require an object. You can call on a function with just its name A method is connected with objects. Calling on a method requires the objects name. Function passes and returns data while methods operate in classes(a blueprint)

6. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

Your answer: I am unsure what hoisiting means. 

Researched answer: It is the movement of declerations to the top before the code is execuded.
